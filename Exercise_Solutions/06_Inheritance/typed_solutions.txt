1) What are protected class members?
Protected class members are members are attributes of a class which can only be accessed
by friends and derived classes.

2) What are virtual functions?
Virtual functions are functions which are defined using virtual in a base class and then 
are overwritten in the derived classes.

3) What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a class containing at least one abstract function, i.e. a virtual function set to 0.
No objects of this type of class can exist.

4) Explain dynamic polymorphism.
Dynamic polymorphism means that a pointer to a base class can then point to a derived class.
It is achieved by function overriding. It occurs when a derived class has a definition for one
of the member functions of the base class, and allows us to work with user inputs which do not
need to be known at compile time.

5) Why destructors should be made virtual?
Destructors should be made virtual to avoid that the wrong destructor 
 is called when we define child classes of a base class.
